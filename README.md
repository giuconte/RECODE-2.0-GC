## 1. Background and Motivation

The RECODE platform addresses the escalating global burden of neurocognitive disorders‚Äîsuch as Alzheimer's‚Äîand provides a **scalable, remote Computerized Cognitive Training (CCT)** model. Research demonstrates moderate improvements in global cognition, memory, attention, and executive functioning among older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment or early dementia using remote CCT tools built with frameworks like **jsPsych** ([de Leeuw, 2015](https://www.jspsych.org)) and **JATOS** ([Lange et al., 2015](https://www.jatos.org/jsPsych-and-JATOS.html)). Commercial solutions, however, are often proprietary, expensive, and rarely localized for non-English users.

RECODE‚Äë2.0‚ÄëGC adapts the clinician-validated volume _‚ÄúDemenza: 100 esercizi di stimolazione cognitiva‚Äù_ (Mapelli et al., 2007) into an open-source, adaptive, Italian-language web platform. It supports home-based or hybrid delivery using only mouse and keyboard, securely hosted through **JATOS**, ensuring full control over data privacy and compliance.

This frozen version was used in a preregistered pilot (Ethics Protocol #4246, University of Padua, Feb‚ÄìJun 2025), with sessions conducted under informed consent and without inclusion of personally identifiable data.

## 4. Installation

### 4.1 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/giuconte/RECODE-2.0-GC.git
cd RECODE-2.0-GC
```

## 5. Architecture Overview

RECODE‚Äë2.0‚ÄëGC is constructed on a **three‚Äëtier architecture** to support remote delivery, interactive training, and adaptive progression.

### üñ•Ô∏è 1. Frontend (Client‚ÄëSide)

- Implemented using **jsPsych 7.2**, a modular JS framework for behavioral research, enabling responsive and timed stimulus presentation with precision control :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
- Structure:
  - `app/js/plugins/` contains custom plugins for each exercise category.
  - Core logic `app/js/timeline.js` loads stimuli and builds the session timeline.
  - Adaptive logic implemented in `app/js/adaptive.js`, leveraging jsPsych‚Äôs `data.addProperties()` for embedding metadata.
  - User interface styled with SASS & CSS (`app/css`), adhering to responsive layouts and WCAG 2.1-AA contrast guidelines.

- Data collection is handled through jsPsych's data module, with trial-level parameters such as `stimulus`, `correct_response`, and `trial_duration` captured precisely :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Backend (Deployment & Data Logging)

- The platform is deployed using **JATOS (Just Another Tool for Online Studies)** version 3.x for session management and secure data storage :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
  - Study comprises sequential components: `comp-intro`, `comp-training`, `comp-end`.
  - Each participant‚Äôs session is associated with a unique result key via `window.jatos.studyResultPortKey`.
  - At block completion, data is transmitted using `jatos.submitResultData(jsPsych.data.get().json(), jatos.startNextComponent)` to ensure atomic save-and-advance behavior :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
  - Server-side, JATOS stores JSON-formatted session logs, accessible via the UI/API and downloadable by researchers :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Configuration & Adaptive Progression Engine

- All stimuli, difficulty settings, session parameters, and UI elements are abstracted into JSON files: `config/exercises.json`, `config/levels.json`, and `config/uiSettings.json`.
- The adaptive model follows a stair-case algorithm:
  - Accuracy ‚â• 80% over three consecutive blocks triggers a level increase.
  - Accuracy ‚â§ 50% over two blocks yields a downward adjustment.
- Adaptive logic executes immediately after each block, updating session state and storing progression history via `jsPsych.data`.

## 6. Exercise Taxonomy and Logic

Exercises derive from the categories defined in Mapelli et al. (2007):

1. **Orientation** ‚Äì Time/place context (e.g., "Which season is it?")  
2. **Memory** ‚Äì Verbal immediate/delayed recall (5‚Äì10 words)  
3. **Attention** ‚Äì Visual search, Stroop-like color-word tasks  
4. **Language** ‚Äì Picture naming, word‚Äìimage matching, fluency prompts  
5. **Executive Function** ‚Äì Digit sequencing, arithmetic operations

Each exercise is implemented through jsPsych plugins:

- Trials are created as objects with parameters like `type`, `stimulus`, and `choices`.
- A block of 10 trials is assembled and appended to the timeline.
- Each trial records response accuracy and reaction time.
- Upon completing a block, aggregate statistics are computed and logged to data and JATOS server.

Plugins are standard jsPsych types (e.g., `html-button-response`, `image-keyboard-response`) with minimal customization to align with stimuli types and desired trial dynamics :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

## 7. Session Flow and Adaptive Progression

The session timeline is carefully structured to optimize engagement and measurement fidelity:

1. **Introduction** ‚Äì Welcome screen; demographic survey via `survey-html-form`.
2. **Avatar & Settings** ‚Äì Participants choose a cartoon avatar and may adjust font size or color contrast.
3. **Practice Phase** ‚Äì 1‚Äì2 trial practice blocks per category; familiarisation only.
4. **Training Phase**:
   - Each of the five categories includes 3‚Äì5 blocks of 10 trials.
   - Block order follows a fixed round-robin sequence.
   - After each block, the adaptive engine evaluates performance:
     - ‚â•80% accuracy x3 ‚Üí up difficulty level.
     - ‚â§50% accuracy x2 ‚Üí decrease difficulty.
5. **Mid-Session Break** ‚Äì Rest screen with optional performance summary at ~50%.
6. **Final Phase & Questionnaire** ‚Äì Completion with subjective measures (e.g., fatigue, satisfaction).
7. **Conclusion** ‚Äì Feedback display, session summary, exit code, therapist notification.

Detailed session metadata (trial outcomes, adherence, progression) is stored and transmitted block by block for security and reliability.

## 8. Avatar and Feedback System

Participant engagement is enhanced through four selectable avatars:

- Selections: youth/female, youth/male, senior/female, senior/male.
- The `avatarManager.js` module controls visual presentations, speech, and feedback logic.
- Avatar includes:
  - `on_start` animation.
  - Mid-block interjections (e.g., encouragement if accuracy falls <60%).
  - Celebratory feedback (confetti, applause audio) for ‚â•90% accuracy.
  - Audio cues generated via TTS or recorded speech files.
- Avatar behavior is synchronized with trial events via jsPsych‚Äôs `on_load` callbacks and event-based triggering.

## 9. Data Handling and Privacy

Protecting participant data is paramount. RECODE‚Äë2.0‚ÄëGC adheres to **Privacy by Design**, collecting only essential data, ensuring client‚Äëside pseudonymisation, and encrypting transit and storage channels :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

### Data Collected

- Responses, reaction times, block-level accuracy  
- Meta properties via `jsPsych.data.addProperties()` (e.g., subject code, timestamp, session ID) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- No personally identifying information is gathered (e.g., name, IP, email).  
- Stimuli and level progression logs captured conditionally to enable longitudinal adaptation.

### Data Flow

1. Captured by jsPsych (browser memory) ‚ûù annotated with metadata ‚ûù exported as CSV/JSON payload.
2. Automatically submitted via `jatos.submitResultData()` to JATOS back-end. JATOS stores research data, including run times and worker identifiers, and supports data deletion on participant abort :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
3. Researchers download raw JSON/CSV via JATOS GUI or API for backup and analysis :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

### Privacy & Security Best Practices

- **HTTPS/TLS encryption** enforced for all client-server communication.  
- **Minimal data collection**, storing only necessary behavioural traces :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  
- **Server-side access control** ensures that only authorized personnel can export or delete data.  
- **Data retention schedules** recommended (default 5 years, but configurable via JATOS settings).  
- **Regular audit logs** should be enabled to track all access events.

### Ethical Compliance

The trial was approved by the University of Padua Ethics Committee (Protocol #4246, Dec 2023). Participants provided informed consent and were instructed they could cease the session at any point, triggering data deletion via `jatos.abortStudy()` :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. Compliance with GDPR and Italian privacy law (D.Lgs 196/2003, amended via GDPR) has been ensured, with strong emphasis on pseudonymisation, limited retention, and role-based access.

## 10. Known Bugs and Limitations

This is a proof-of-concept release and still under development. Below is a non-exhaustive list of open issues tracked via GitHub Issues:

1. **Audio feedback overlaps** if participant clicks rapidly in avatar speech.  
2. **Touch support inconsistent**: most tasks rely on mouse/keyboard; touch input works on tablets but lacks calibration.  
3. **Edge-case race condition** in adaptive progression‚Äîrare misclassification of two-level jumps.  
4. **Browser compatibility**: works reliably on Chrome and Firefox; minor CSS displacements observed in Edge.  
5. **Lack of internationalisation** ‚Äî the entire UI and stimuli are Italian only; no language-toggle available.  
6. **Accessibility**: although color contrast meets WCAG AA, screen-reader support is minimal.  
7. **Offline state**: partial session progress may not persist if connection drops; autosave is per-block only.  
8. **Stimulus uniformity**: some pictures duplicated across categories because of asset reuse.

For a full issue list, see the [Issues tab on GitHub](https://github.com/giuconte/RECODE‚Äë2.0‚ÄëGC/issues). Future maintenance release 2.1 will address the majority of these.
